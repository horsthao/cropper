  notes: The black apical marking does not extend far down the edge of the wing. It
    should extend to vein 3 for a large white - to at least below the upper black
    spot. This gives the apical marking a rather curved appearance whereas the apical
    markings in your picture are roughly triangular.
  prediction: Small White (Pieris rapae)
